# 👋 Hi, I’m Lucia Uchegbu 🤓

## 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This repository highlights my work as a **Data Analyst**, showcasing projects where I analyze data, generate insights, and communicate findings through clear and meaningful **data visualizations**.

---
## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me
I am a detail-oriented data analyst with experience in **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**, and a background in **Microbiology**. I enjoy transforming data into clear insights and visualizations that support decision-making, with a strong interest in applying data analysis to solve real-world biological and health-related problems. I’m currently learning Python and intentionally building skills toward **bioinformatics**, with a focus on single-cell genomics research in disease and public health.

**Core Skills:**  
- **Data Analysis and Insights**. cleaning, preparing, and analyzing data to support decision-making and identify trends.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. Exploring and visualizing datasets to uncover patterns, anomalies, and actionable insights.
- **SQL and Database Management**. Writing SQL queries to extract, manipulate and retrieve data from large datasets for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**. Creating detailed dashboards and reports that communicate findings clearly.
- **Python for Data Analytics**. Applying Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy,and Matplotlib for data cleaning, analysis and visualization.  
- **AI-assisted Research**.Leveraging AI tools to support research and analysis.

## 📁 Projects
A glimpse of some of the projects I've been working on.

### 🔹 Project 1: *Workplace Safety Performance And Incident Analysis*
**Description:** 
This project analyzes workplace safety and incident data across different departments and shifts to identify trends, high-risk areas, and opportunities for improving safety performance. The goal was to provide actionable insights for management to reduce incidents and improve reporting and resolution times.

**Data Source:**  
- for data cleaning, analysis, and creating interactive dashboards.

**Tools Used:**  
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Dashboard Design)

**Key Insights:**  
- 2,000 incidents were recorded, with 956 resulting in injuries, indicating a high workplace safety risk that requires immediate attention..
- **Shift Analysis**: The night shift recorded the highest number of incidents, indicating increased risk during low-visibility and high-fatigue periods.
- **Department Risk**: Production and Maintenance departments reported the highest incident volumes, suggesting elevated exposure to operational and equipment-related hazards.
- **Incident Types**: Near-miss and slip incidents were the most frequent, followed closely by injury-related cases, showing recurring safety issues rather than isolated events.
- **Cause Analysis**: Environmental factors and procedural violations were the leading causes of incidents, highlighting gaps in workplace controls and safety compliance.
- **Reporting & Resolution Times**: The average incident reporting time (45.52 minutes) is relatively high, increasing escalation risk, while resolution times (~12 hours) remain uniform across severity levels, suggesting limited incident prioritization.
  
**High-Risk Patterns**
-Departments with high incident volumes also show higher injury counts, indicating weak preventive controls.
-Incident trends remain consistently high over time, showing limited impact of existing safety measures.
-Reprated incident types suggest root causes are not being adequately addressed.

**Key Recommendation**
-Reduce reporting delays by introducing fast-reporting systems (e.g., QR-based or automated alerts).
-Target safety training in high-risk departments and shifts to reduce injury rates.
-Reprioritize medium- and low-severity incidents to prevent escalation.
-Conduct root cause analysis on the top recurring incident types.
-Use this dashboard as a supervisory KPI tool to monitor incidents, injuries, and response times in real time.
